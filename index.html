              The twelve jyotirlinga temples
            </h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
              According to shiva Mahapuran, once Brahma (the god of creation)
              and Vishnu (the form of God during Preservation) had an argument
              over supremacy of creation. To settle the debate, Supreme God
              Shiva pierced the three worlds appearing as a huge Infinite Pillar
              of Light, the Jyotirlinga which later cooled into the Holy
              Mountain Annamalai (on which the Temple of Arunachaleshvara is
              located). Vishnu and Brahma split their ways to downwards and
              upwards respectively to find the end of the light in either
              direction. Brahma lied that he found out the end, while Vishnu
              conceded his defeat. This lie of Brahma angered Shiva making him
              curse Brahma that even though he is the creator of the universe he
              would not be worshipped. The jyotirlinga is the Supreme Siva,
              partless reality, out of which Shiva appeared in another Form,
              Lingodbhava. The jyotirlinga shrines are Temples where Shiva
              appeared as a fiery column of light.

              The pancharama temples
            </h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
              The Pancharama Kshetras (or the Pancharamas) are five ancient
              Hindu temples of Lord Shiva situated in Andhra Pradesh. The
              Sivalingas at these temples are made from a single Sivalinga. As
              per the legend, this Sivalinga was owned by the demon king
              Tarakasura. No one could win over him due to the power of this
              Sivalinga. Finally, Lord Kumaraswamy, the son of Lord Shiva broke
              the Sivalinga into five pieces and killed Tarakasura.

                      Lord Shiva took this avatar at the time when Lord Brahma
                      and Lord Vishnu had a fight over superiority. When Lord
                      Brahma lied about his superiority, Shiva took the form of
                      Bhairava and cut off Lord Brahma's fifth head. Severing a
                      Brahma's head made Lord Shiva guilty of the crime of
                      killing a Brahmin and hence Shiva had to carry the skull

                      Lord Shiva once took the form of Indra to test one of his
                      devotees. That is why he came to be known as Sureshwar.
                      Once a child Upamanyu, the son of sage Vyaghrapad
                      meditated to please Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva, with an
                      intention to test his devotion, appeared there along with
                      Goddess Parvati, both disguised as Indra and Indrani,
                      respectively.
